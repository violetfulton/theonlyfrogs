    <h2>About the Achievement</h2>
    <p>
      In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, achieving 100% completion involves completing a variety of tasks,
      including collecting all furniture, clothing, and finishing the museum, as well as completing public works
      projects and befriending all villagers. This diary will follow along my journey to accomplish this feat!
